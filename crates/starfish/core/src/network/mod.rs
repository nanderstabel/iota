//! This module defines the network interface, and provides network
//! implementations for the consensus protocol.
//!
//! Having an abstract network interface allows
//! - simplying the semantics of sending data and serving requests over the
//!   network
//! - hiding implementation specific types and semantics from the consensus
//!   protocol
//! - allowing easy swapping of network implementations, for better performance
//!   or testing
//!
//! When modifying the client and server interfaces, the principle is to keep
//! the interfaces low level, close to underlying implementations in semantics.
//! For example, the client interface exposes sending messages to a specific
//! peer, instead of broadcasting to all peers. Subscribing to a stream of
//! blocks gets back the stream via response, instead of delivering the stream
//! directly to the server. This keeps the logic agnostics to the underlying
//! network outside of this module, so they can be reused easily across network
//! implementations.
